# Password Hasher Plus

Password Hasher Plus is a replacement for the Password Hasher
extension which unfortunately is not developed anymore and does not
work correctly with multi-process Firefox.

This extension is a port of the Chrome extension of the same name
which generates hash words that are identical to the hash words
generated by Password Hasher, if compatibility mode is enabled.

Unfortunately you will have to migrate site tags and versions manually.

## Quickstart Guide:

1) First time only: check that site settings are correct and that you have enabled compatibility mode if you're coming from the old Firefox plugin.
1) Input your master password in the password field
1) Press the '#' button near the password field or use Ctrl+# to hash the password in place
1) Optional: Use the '*' button or press Ctrl+* to check either your master password or the hash word (depending on whether you've hashed your master password already or not).
1) Login
